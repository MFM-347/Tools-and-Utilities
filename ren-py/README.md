# RenPy

  RenPy is a Python-based command-line tool designed to streamline the process of renaming multiple files in a directory.

## How to Use
To use RenPy, you'll need to specify the target directory and the base name you'd like for the files.

#### Command Format
```shell
py ren.py <directory> <base_name>
```

- `<directory>`: Path to the directory containing the files you want to rename.
- `<base_name>`: The new base name for each file, to be followed by a unique number.
